This project was developed with the idea of hiring professional of different skill during the COVID time. A simple idea which was implemented using just Javascript , HTML/CSS , Node.js/express and Firebase . 

This repository contains  two folder , one called Customer for the users to hire professional and another folder called Professional for professional to see their progress and contact user who contacted them . 

Though the project does not have much of a feature but still it was my first project as a web developer so kind of keeping this for memory purpose to see my progress.
